 *                     `this.next` method, we can specify each property as as a

 * Approach 1: Set (or Hash Table)
 *
 * Intuition:          If we use a `Set` data structure to keep track of nodes 
 *                     that we've seen previously, we can traverse the linked 
 *                     list and return the first duplicateÂ node.
 *
 * Time complexity:    O(n)
 * 
 *                     In the worst case, we must run through and process each
 *                     node in the linked list, `ListNode`, which takes O(n)
 *                     time.
 *
 * Space complexity:   O(n)
 * 
 *                     In the worst case, we store n - 1 (i.e., all) nodes in 
 *                     the linked list, which takes O(n) space.
 * 
 * `head` is a linked list, created by a call of the `ListNode` function with
 * the values of the linked list passed in as an array for the argument.
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * 
 * The return value is the value of the 
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
function detectCycle(head) {
  let visited = new Set() // keep track of all `visited` nodes
  /**
   * Each node of the linked list will be traversed by calling the `.next` 
   * method on the instance of the `ListNode` function, which is represented by
   * `head`.
   * 
   * So, we assign the variable `node` to `head` so that we can later traverse
   * through all the nodes in the linked list (again, by using `ListNode`s 
   * `.next` method) until we find the starting point (duplicate node) of the 
   * cycle.

 * Approach 2: Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
 *
 * Intuition:          The idea behind the algorithm is, if you have two
 *                     pointers in a linked list, one moving twice as fast (the
 *                     hare) than the other (the tortoise), then if they
 *                     intersect, there is a cycle in the linked list. If the
 *                     hare and tortoise don't intersect, then there is no
 *                     cycle.
 *
 *                     In the problem, we're asked to return a boolean for
 *                     whether or not there is a cycle. You are given a linked
 *                     list, `ListNode`, with each node's value that is
 *                     represented by the `.val` method, and a pointer (which
 *                     points to the next node after each node value) that is
 *                     represented by the `.next` method.
 * 
 *                     Visualize the linked list as a kite with a hanging string
 *                     rotated to the right by 90 degrees. The nodes that make
 *                     up the kite are cyclic while the nodes that make up the
 *                     kite's string are acyclic.
 * 
 *                     All nodes are labeled from 0 to C - 1, where C is the
 *                     length of the cycle. The acyclic nodes of the kite's
 *                     string are labelled from -F to -1, where F is the number
 *                     of nodes outside of the cycle (you can think of F as how
 *                     many nodes outside of the kite, or far away along the 
 *                     string). 
 * 
 *                     After F iterations, `tortoise` points to node 0 and
 *                     `hare` points to node h, where F === h (mod C). (This in 
 *                     the example given in LeetCode's guided solution, this 
 *                     works out to F = 3, h = 2, and C = 5, and when you solve
 *                     for F, you get 3 == 2 mod 5 => 3 === 3.) This is because
 *                     `hare` traverses 2F nodes over the course of F 
 *                     iterations, exactly F of which are in the cycle. 
 * 
 *                     After C - h (5 - 3, so 2) more iterations, 
 *                     `tortoise` obviously points to node C - h, but (less 
 *                     obviously) `hare` also points to the same node. To see
 *                     why, remember that `hare` traverses 2F, or 2(C - h), from
 *                     its starting position of h (or 3):
 * 
 *                     h + 2(C - h) = 2C - h === C - h (mod C)
 * 
 *                     Thereforce, given that the list is cyclic, `hare` and
 *                     `tortoise` will eventually both point to the same node,
 *                     known as the `intersection`.
 * 
 *                     Given that phase 1 finds an intersection, phase 2 
 *                     proceeds to find the node that is the entrance to the
 *                     cycle. To do so, we initialize two more pointers: 
 *                     `pointer1`, which pointers to the head of the list, and
 *                     `pointer2`, which points to the intersection. Then, we
 *                     advance each of them by 1 until they meet; the node where
 *                     they meet is the entrance to ths cycle, so we return it.
 *
 * Time complexity:    O(n)
 * 
 *                     For cyclic lists, `hare` and `tortoise` will point to the
 *                     same node after F + C - h iterations, as demonstrated in
 *                     the proof of correctness. 
 * 
 *                     F + C - h <= F + C = n, so phase 1 runs in O(n) time. 
 *                     Phase 2 runs for F < n iterations, so it also runs in
 *                     O(n) time.
 * 
 *                     For acyclic lists, `hare` will reach the end of the list 
 *                     in roughly n/2 iterations, causing the function to return
 *                     before phase 2. Therefore, regardless of which list
 *                     category the algorithm receives as input, it runs in time
 *                     linearly proportional to the number of nodes.
 *                     
 * Space complexity:   O(1)
 * 
 *                     Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithms allocates only 
 *                     pointers, so it runs with constant overall memory usage.
