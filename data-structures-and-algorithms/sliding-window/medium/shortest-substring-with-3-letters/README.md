# (NOT LeetCode problem) Shortest Substring with 3 Letters
This problem is very similar to the LeetCode problem, [1358. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters/).

Given a string `s` consisting of letters `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the length of the **shortest substring** containing at least one occurrence of all three letters (`a`, `b`, `c`). If there isn't any, return -1.
