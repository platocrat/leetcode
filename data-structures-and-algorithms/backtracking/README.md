# Backtracking 
Backtracking is an "algorithm framework": a general strategy for solving problems with certain characteristics. 

Backtracking is related to an algorithm called depth-first search (DFS). Backtracking can be seen as doing DFS on a special type of tree called a "decision tree". This view makes backtracking easier to grasp because trees and DFS are concepts we are already familiar with.
