 * Approach 1: Set (or Hash Table)
 *
 * Intuition:                If we use a `Set` data structure to keep track of
 *                           nodes that we've seen previously, we can traverse
 *                           the linked list and return the first duplicate
 *                          Â node.
 *
 * Time complexity:         O(n)
 *                          In the worst case, we must run through and process
 *                          each node in the linked list, `ListNode`, which
 *                          takes O(n) time.
 *
 * Space complexity:        O(n)
 *                          In the worst case, we store n - 1 (i.e., all) nodes
 *                          in the linked list, which takes O(n) space.
