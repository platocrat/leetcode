 * Intuition:          Since each node needs to hold *its own value*, 
 *                     represented by the `this.val` method, and *a pointer to 
 *                     the next node in the list*, represented by the 
 *                     `this.next` method, we can specify each property as as a
 *                     method of our `ListNode` function.
 * 

 * Defintion for a singly-linked list.

/**

 * Approach 1: Set (or Hash Table)
 *
 * Intuition:          If we use a `Set` data structure to keep track of nodes 
 *                     that we've seen previously, we can traverse the linked 
 *                     list and return the first duplicateÂ node.
 *
 * Time complexity:    O(n)
 * 
 *                     In the worst case, we must run through and process each
 *                     node in the linked list, `ListNode`, which takes O(n)
 *                     time.
 *
 * Space complexity:   O(n)
 * 
 *                     In the worst case, we store n - 1 (i.e., all) nodes in 
 *                     the linked list, which takes O(n) space.

   *

   * through all the nodes in the linked list (again, by using `LinkNode`s 
   * `.next` method) until we find the starting point (duplicate node) of the

/**

 * Approach 2: Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
 *
 * Intuition:          The idea behind the algorithm is, if you have two
 *                     pointers in a linked list, one moving twice as fast (the
 *                     hare) than the other (the tortoise), then if they
 *                     intersect, there is a cycle in the linked list. If the
 *                     hare and tortoise don't intersect, then there is no
 *                     cycle.
 *
 *                     In the problem, we're asked to return a boolean for
 *                     whether or not there is a cycle. You are given a linked
 *                     list, `LinkNode`, with each node's value that is
 *                     represented by the `.val` method, and a pointer (which
 *                     points to the next node after each node value) that is
 *                     represented by the `.next` method.
 *
 * Time complexity:    O()
 *
 * Space complexity:   O()
 *
 * @param {Number[]} head
 * @return {Number} node
