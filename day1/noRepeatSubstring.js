/**
 * @dev
 * LeetCode Reference:
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
 *
 * Time complexity:   O(n) since we run and process each element in
 *                    n-sized string once
 *
 * Space complexity:  O(K), where K is the number of characters in the string,
 *                    however, since we know that there are 26 possible English
 *                    letters, we can say we will store a constant fixed number
 *                    of characters, thus space complexity is O(1)
 *
 * Difficulty:        Medium
